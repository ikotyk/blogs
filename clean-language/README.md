> - Joseph Campbell

Start with clean question and example conversation to illustrate what it is like to have a clean conversation.

## The power of metaphor
How metaphors work for me.
With metaphors in your mind you can fly like a bird.
It helps me to move forward, I get energy from the metaphor.
Moving forward, surprising energy, it takes me somewhere, enables new ways of thinking and doing.
The energy is locked in dark (uncomfortable) metaphors.
One word, multiple experiences - details of metaphors are unique.
