## The power of metaphor
### Metaphors improve comprehension
What is a metaphor? It is a figure of speech that describes an object or action in a way that isn’t literally true, but helps explain an idea or make a comparison. 

[//]: # (what do you mean with 'isn't literally true'? personally a metaphor is an image of an hidden undercurrent. as soon as I give words to the metaphor, it becomes true, maybe that makes the meaphor so powerfully, it's personal truth. but maybe we mean the same ;-) )

The best ones link something which is less understood to something which is more understood. As a result, good metaphors improve our comprehension of the ideas we might have not understood otherwise. Metaphors add colours to the story and make it "sticky". They enable us to show instead of tell.
[//]: #  (just a thought: is it possible / helpfull to ask a 'metaphoric question', so people can experience that 'power' at this point?)

### Metaphors change the way we think. - key message
Did you know that on average we use six metaphors a minute? Surprised? Me too! They are so embedded into our speech that mostly we are unconscious about them. Research suggests that metaphors actually change the way we think of a concept on an unconscious level. In 2011 there was a study conducted in which two groups of readers have been presented with two articles describing the same crime. In the first article they compared it to a beast and in another to a disease. When asked to solve the crime issue, readers of the first article suggested control strategies while the second group came up with diagnostic or treatment strategies. So actually changing the metaphor changes how we think about the issue or an idea at hand.
[//]: # (awesome piece! -> shouldn't the title be: changing our metaphors change the way we think? because I think I think because of my current metaphor, so that one doesn't change me at this moment)

### Metaphors are capable of changing your experience
In communication we often fail to see the connection the other person is making in their head. So we declare it nonsense.
[//]: # (when it is a connection that differs from our connection)

It's no wonder that we clash with each other, because we assign different meaning to the same things.  
In my clean language workshop it was an eye opening experience to observe a magnitude of metaphors people create in response to the same question.

## How metaphors work for me.
If I connect to my metaphor (that can be with help of somebody else that asks a clean question or even a clean question that I ask myself) I feel unblocked. My mind is often 'blocking' me.
With the metaphors you feel a new sence of freedom, a bit like 'flying like a bird'.
That picture then helps me to move forward, I am sensing that I am getting energy from that metaphor.
Moving forward, surprising energy, it takes me somewhere, enables new ways of thinking and doing.
The energy is locked in dark (uncomfortable) metaphors.
One word, multiple experiences - details of metaphors are unique.

This metaphor even takes me back to my days as a child. Even then, the thought of flying like a bird sparked nice thoughts and feelings.


## Clean language and clean questions
Clean Language is a questioning technique used for discovering, exploring and working with people's own personal metaphors.
Here are two most commonly used questions:
What kind of ‘x’ is that 'x'?
Is there anything else about ‘x’?
(where ‘X’ is a word or phrase that the client has used)
[//]: # (do we want to explain a bit what is meant with 'clean' ,how that works?)

## Personal experience with clean language
With clean language I have come to realization that my own metaphors are not just words I use to describe my experiences. They are the views into the models running my life and defining my behavior. Recently, my friend and I have been exploring our learning experiences with the help of clean questions. Here is how our conversation looked like:
F: When you are learning it is like what?
I: I am like a sponge.
F: You are like a sponge, and what kind of sponge is that sponge?
I: It is a dry, yellow, hour glass shaped sponge.
F: And it is a dry, yellow, hour glass shaped sponge, is there anything else about that dry?
I: It absorbs all the knowledge like water.
F: And when it absorbs all the knowledge what happens next?
I: And then it is full and water starts to spill over and it cannot absorb anymore; and then, over time, it dries out...
F: What would you like to have happen?
I: I would like my knowledge stay with me instead of drying out. And I want to keep learning indefinitely without being limited by saturated sponge.

This is the moment of deep realization of something profound about my way of learning. This is exactly what I experience, I am a lifelong learner, but the knowledge tends to dry out over time, sometimes to the point that I can read the same book as if for the first time. This kind of epiphany makes me want to change my metaphor. Before I was proud of being a sponge-learner, now I see it's limitations.

By exploring metaphors of other people I help them understand themselves better and also get a view into their worlds and can upgrade my own metaphors.

[//]: # (while I was reading your great metaphor, I suddenly realised that I had 'an opinion' about your metaphor, something like 'but that isn't bad'. having an opinion about someones metaphor is something that can be a natural response, but is not 'helping'. do we want to add something about not being opiniated about someones metaphor ? ;-)  )

## Applications of clean language
There are numerous applications of clean language. It is a perfect tool for one-on-one coaching and is often used for executive coaching. Using clean questions, the coach helps their clients discover the limiting patterns and beliefs that hold them back, reinforce positive beliefs, make unconscious knowledge conscious. 
Client also get to experience an exquisite attention to their words. It is unique in itself as usually people listen to respond and the skill of listening becomes a rare phenomenon. 

Clean language can also be applied in a team setting and be used for conflict resolution, team development and motivation, joint understanding and focus. 
Every team is going thru these development stages: forming, storming, norming and performing. The most challenging one and emotionally draining is storming. During this phase team members tend to disagree a lot and conflicts are not uncommon. It is possible to minimize the duration of this stage by equipping the teams with the clean questions as a conflict resolution technique that will bring them closer into their optimal performance. 

My favorite part of clean language and technique I used most often is a clean setup. It is very simple, it only has 3 questions:
For ... to go just as you'd like, it will be like what?
You'd like to be like what?
What support or resources do you need?
I use it for various meetings to set up the stage and cater for the desires and expectations of each participant. What is the most amazing about it is that most of the time it goes just as we'd like and we get exactly what we wanted. It keeps consistently delivering a positive result.

### Coaching
Executive Coaching
1*1 coaching

### Clean language for teams

#### Team meetings
When team members communicate, they often communicate from their own 'perspective' (background, expectations, goals, etc)
this 'perspective' can make it hard to understand eachother. When their communication lacks 'flow', their output will hurt in some way.

Conflict resolution

Team development and motivation

Train an promote attentive listening

Joint understanding and focus

Feedback tool

Strengthening relationships
Train your memory(if you struggle to repeat what the other person said)
Empathy, understanding, clarity of communication, neutrality, objectivity
Discover your own patterns and detect patterns of others
Self awareness and acceptance of others (From contempt to curiosity)

### Other applications
Gathering requirements for projects
Market research
Sales
Recruitment
Techniques for professional communicators

## What do we want to use it for
Help people to be open to change.

Change is like what ?
Working here is like what?
When you are in a best working environment you are like what?

## Contracts?
Do we want to talk about contracts here?

## We need an ending here, not sure what it should be



TODO
- clean setup
- checklist (where are we now, what do we still have to work on)
- @Joel: first review what we have and feedback
