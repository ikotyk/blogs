> “If you want to change the world, you have to change the metaphor.”
> - Joseph Campbell

Complexity of our world is growing. It means that there is no single person who knows the answers to the problems we are dealing with. Dealing with complex problems requires other approach, it requires collaboration - people with diverse perspectives working together. The heart of collaboration is communication. Having effective communication techniques in place becomes the necessity for our success. Link these two sentences. We must invest in communication skills if we want to prepare for the future and maintain the competitive edge.
There are many tools one can learn to improve his communication skills. Today we would like to talk about one of them -  Clean Language.

## The power of metaphor
### Metaphors improve comprehension
What is a metaphor? It is a figure of speech that describes an object or action in a way that isn’t literally true, but helps explain an idea or make a comparison. The best ones link something which is less understood to something which is more understood. As a result, good metaphors improve our comprehension of the ideas we might have not understood otherwise. Metaphors add colours to the story and make it "sticky". They enable us to show instead of tell.

### Changing metaphors changes the way we think
Did you know that on average we use six metaphors a minute? Surprised? Me too! They are so embedded into our speech that mostly we are unconscious about them. Research suggests that metaphors actually change the way we think of a concept on an unconscious level. In 2011 there was a study conducted in which two groups of readers have been presented with two articles describing the same crime. In the first article the crime was compared to a beast and in another to a disease. When asked to solve the crime issue, readers of the first article suggested control strategies while the second group came up with diagnostic or treatment strategies. So actually changing the metaphor changes how we think about the issue or an idea at hand.

(Q) for you to have a great Xebia Knowledge Exchange, it will be like what
(A) it will be like a radar system of an old school watch
(Q) is there more about the radar system of the old school watch
(A) They are strong radars that have the power to bring forth other radars
(Q) and whereabouts is that strong radars that have the power to bring forth other radars
(A) its in my body
(Q) is there more about the radar system of the old school watch?
(A) it is moving
(Q) and the moving radar system, it is like what?
(A) one big energy field
(Q) what kind of energy field
(A) an energy field that grows
(Q) where is that energy field
(A) all around me (and growing)
(Q) then what happens
(A) I move that energy towards others
(Q) ...

### bla something
In my clean language workshop it was an eye opening experience to observe a magnitude of metaphors people create in response to the same question. We've been asked the question: "When you are stuck, it is like what?". No two answers were the same, these are a few examples: "It is like riding a bike with the headwind", "It is like being cornered and the walls are narrowing down, I am grasping for air", "It is like having heavy handcuffs on my wrists".
The learning here is that everybody attaches their own meaning of a subject/topic/question, feels and acts accordingly to that meaning. It's no wonder that we misunderstand each other, or sometimes even clash. But don't worry, clean language is capable of helping us to clarify these misunderstandings and enable us to move forward.


Most of the time we assume we know what the other person means.



## Clean language and clean questions
Clean Language is a questioning technique used for discovering, exploring and working with people's own personal metaphors.
Clean means the questioner only uses the words of the "questionee" without adding their own interpretations. This way the language of the questioner is *clean* from their own words.
Here are two most commonly used questions:
What kind of ‘x’ is that 'x'?
Is there anything else about ‘x’?
(where ‘X’ is a word or phrase that the client has used, e.g "what kind of energy field is that energy field", where X = energy field)

## Personal experience with clean language
With clean language I have come to realization that my own metaphors are not just words I use to describe my experiences. They are the views into the models running my life and defining my behavior. Recently, my friend and I have been exploring our learning experiences with the help of clean questions. Here is how our conversation looked like:
(Q) When you are learning you are like what?
(A) I am like a sponge.
(Q) You are like a sponge, and what kind of sponge is that sponge?
(A) It is a dry, yellow, hour glass shaped sponge.
(Q) And it is a dry, yellow, hour glass shaped sponge, is there anything else about that dry?
(A) It absorbs all the knowledge like water.
(Q)And when it absorbs all the knowledge what happens next?
(A) And then it is full and water starts to spill over and it cannot absorb anymore; and then, over time, it dries out...
(Q) What would you like to have happen?
(A) I would like my knowledge stay with me instead of drying out. And I want to keep learning indefinitely without being limited by saturated sponge.

This is the moment of deep realization of something profound about my way of learning. This is exactly what I experience, I am a lifelong learner, but the knowledge tends to dry out over time, sometimes to the point that I can read the same book as if for the first time. This kind of epiphany makes me want to change my metaphor. Before I was proud of being a sponge-learner, now I see it's limitations.
Action: add about opinion of the metaphor of the others.
By exploring metaphors of other people I help them understand themselves better and also get a view into their worlds and can upgrade my own metaphors.

## Applications of clean language
There are numerous applications of clean language. It is a perfect tool for one-on-one coaching and is often used for executive coaching. Using clean questions, the coach helps their clients discover the limiting patterns and beliefs that hold them back, reinforce positive beliefs, make unconscious knowledge conscious.
Client also get to experience an exquisite attention to their words. It is unique in itself as usually people listen to respond and the act of listening becomes a rare phenomenon.

Clean language can also be applied in a team setting and be used for conflict resolution, team development and motivation, joint understanding and focus, building deeper connection.
Every team is going thru number of development stages: forming, storming, norming and performing. The most challenging one and emotionally draining is storming. During this phase team members tend to disagree a lot and conflicts are not uncommon. It is possible to minimize the duration of this stage by equipping the teams with the clean questions as a conflict resolution technique that will bring them closer into their optimal performance.

My favourite part of clean language and technique I used most often is a clean setup. It is very simple, it only has 3 questions:
(I am not sure if I want to put the questions in here)
For ... to go just as you'd like, it will be like what?
You'd like to be like what?
What support or resources do you need?
I use it for various meetings to set up the stage and account for the desires and expectations of each participant. What is the most amazing about it is that most of the time it goes just as we'd like and we get exactly what we wanted. It keeps consistently delivering a desired result.

## Starting with Clean Language
With all great effects that Clean Language has, we want to point out a simple ‘rule of thumb’: use only 2-3 consecutive clean questions around a subject for the sake of the psychological safety of the questioner and the questionee. With Clean Questions you can stir deeper ‘layers’ or emotions and it is important that you are able to support that. So it is our sound advice not to go deeper than ‘level 3’. But do not worry, even if you do not go ‘that deep’, there is still lots to explore. It is best to have your first Clean Language exploration with someone experienced with it.

## Changing our world
What would you like to have happen? How do you want to change the world?

There is no two people with the same answer to these questions. We all are unique, with our own world views, our own unique desires. Is it a personal change that you desire to see, or maybe you would like to improve the communication with your team members, or maybe you are dreaming of transforming your entire organization. Whatever is the scale of the change you envision,

Call to action- Experiment with changing metaphors. What do you want the reader to do with this information?
To learn more, try it out, discover some of their metaphors, change their team/organization/themselves.
Connect to the quote we started with. Talk about how the reader wants to change his/her world and the scale of the change he envisions. Is it a personal change, the team change, or perhaps organizational.

When you are at work, at your best, it is like what?

We all have aspirations big and small. We all want to change something, only the scale is different. Maybe you want to improve your own communication style, or maybe you are dreaming of improving collaboration in your team, or even your organization
