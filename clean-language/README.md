Start with clean question and example conversation to illustrate what it is like to have a clean conversation.

## The power of metaphor
### Metaphors improve comprehension
What is a metaphor? It is a figure of speech that describes an object or action in a way that isn’t literally true, but helps explain an idea or make a comparison. The best ones link something which is less understood to something which is more understood. As a result, good metaphors improve our comprehension of the ideas we might have not understood otherwise. Metaphors add colours to the story and make it "sticky". They enable us to show instead of telling.

### Metaphors change the way we think. - key message
Did you know that on average we use six metaphors a minute? Surprised? Me too! They are so embedded into our speech that mostly we are unconscious about  them. Research suggests that metaphors actually change the way we think of a concept on an unconscious level. In 2011 there was a study conducted in which two groups of readers have been presented with two articles describing the same crime. In the first article they compared it to a beast and in another to a disease. When asked to solve the crime issue, readers of the first article suggested control strategies while the second group came up with diagnostic or treatment strategies. So actually changing the metaphor changes how we think about the issue or an idea at hand.


### Metaphors are capable of changing your experience
In communication we often fail to see the connection the other person is making in their head. So we declare it nonsense.
It's no wonder that we clash with each other, because we assign different meaning to the same things.  
In my clean language workshop it was an eye opening experience to observe a magnitude of metaphors people create in response to the same question.

How metaphors work for me.
With metaphors in your mind you can fly like a bird.
It helps me to move forward, I get energy from the metaphor.
Moving forward, surprising energy, it takes me somewhere, enables new ways of thinking and doing.
The energy is locked in dark (uncomfortable) metaphors.
One word, multiple experiences - details of metaphors are unique.
