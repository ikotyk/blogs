# A social contract for joyful pairing
One of my favorite practices in software development is pairing, more specifically, joyful pairing.
This article is not about the benefits of pair programming; it is about the *joyful* part.
More insight on the what and how of pair programming can be found in this excellent article: [On Pair Programming](https://martinfowler.com/articles/on-pair-programming.html).

When we utilize this pairing practice in our daily work, we should enjoy it!
Enjoying our work has a positive impact on stress levels and our general health.
The feeling of joy while pairing increases motivation and the likeliness of continued pairing in the future.

Given the benefits of pairing and enjoying work, how can we increase the chances of joyful pairing?
Pairing is a social activity, and, when done wrong, it can feel uncomfortable and exhausting.
There are a few guidelines to inspire a social contract and strengthen the likelihood of joyful pairing in the upcoming sections.

## Feedback without judgment
Most people will probably be familiar with the situation in which you seemingly lose all ability to type as soon as someone observes you.
People new to pairing might recollect these situations and feel uncomfortable before they even start.
They fear their fingers will betray them, or they suddenly forget how to program.
They fear being judged.

Pairing can be a very vulnerable exercise. You show work in progress, knowledge gaps, thinking process.
When I pair with someone new to pairing, I mostly make sure I am the one typing at the start.
I show my partner I make a lot of mistakes, have to look up basics, and need multiple tries to get something right; and that I'm ok showing that.

Your social contract for joyful pairing needs to include the section: no judgment allowed.
Pointing out overlooked errors, sharing an alternate view, or discussing the drawbacks of a particular solution, are all fine.
A benefit of pairing is fast feedback.
This feedback can be without judgment.
For a joyful pairing, you need trust and acceptance, to make the vulnerability less daunting.
