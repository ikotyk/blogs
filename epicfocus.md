# How to assess your team focus / Focused team is a happy team / Driving engagement by creating focus
## Delive value faster
## Symptoms
- Perception of slowness
  - Poorly refined work
  - Everything in progress and nothing is done
- No collaboration
  - Not forced to connect due to lot of different topics
- Team has nothing to show during the sprint review
  - Nothing to get feedback from stakeholders
  - 
## Value stream
One way to examine your development process is to [create a value stream map or VSM](https://xebia.com/blog/how-to-create-a-value-stream-map/). It is basically an inventory of all the activities that happen before a piece of software hits production. You also want to know how much time each of the activities take. Once you have that, you can put them in two buckets: value adding activities and non-value adding or waste. Give examples of activities of each category.
Of course you still don't know what items are valuable by themselves. For that you need another metric.
waste in the process
## Metrics
#### 1. Value adding vs non-value adding product backlog items (Epic stuff vs other stuff)
waste in the content
Add an image of epic vs other stuff.
Excersize similar to mapping the VSM could be performed against your backlog. You could put all the work into same two buckets value adding and non-value adding. Both are important, we need to add new value while maintaining the existing value of our products. Once you have a distribution of work, e.g. ratio between value adding and non-value adding items you can drill down on each of them and get more insights. Having a lot of non-value adding work might create a perception of slowness.
You can go further and drill down into what is on your non-value adding product backlog items and understand what is the underlying issue there, maybe you have a lot of bugs and there is a quality problem, or maybe it is a tech debt that's holding you back and doesn't allow to extend the product. 
Having this data, you can get an idea of your team speed if you devide amount of work done by number of days whithing which it was completed.
You can go further and measure the speed of individual features to see if you can support your perception of slowness with data.
#### 2. Speed of the feature(s) (items per day)
Make an assumption that epics are value adding
Image with the epic speed vs total speed.
How does it compare to the total speed? Is it even close? Or those two are far apart? If your answer to this question is yes, you might want to find out why this is the case. There's is a lot of different routes you can take from here, for example, you could start looking into the actual content of the slow features. In our context we opted for a different route.
Given the symptoms we discussed earlier, the perception of slowness, which is now backed by data, the lack of collaboration, and the unclear sprint goal, we decided to look into parrallel work. 

// This comparison can either give you some answers or raise more questions.
#### 3. Number of parallel value adding contexts
Image with the gantt chart and parallel features
By plotting the work on the different value adding contexts over time you can see where work on these different contexts overlap. Working on different contexts in the same timeframe suggests context switching. 
## Context switching
Most likely you already know that context switching is not your friend but rather an enemy that is stealing your time without you noticing it. And this claim is backed by the research.

## Dream of engagement

- Energy

To get from focus to engagement:

https://noop.nl/2013/02/champfrogs.html Intrinsic motivation caused by having a clear goal, order and stability from focussed roadmap, and relatedness from required collaboration. Intrinsic motivation is strongly correlatred with engagement. https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1096700.pdf

To get from engagement to productivity:

Gallup research: http://hr.uci.edu/partnership/survey/pdf/03-Gallup-Q12-Research.pdf
