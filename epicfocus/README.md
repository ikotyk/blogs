# How to assess your team focus / Focused team is a happy team / Driving engagement by creating focus
## Deliver value faster
There are a bunch of recurring wishes our clients bring to us, one of which is speed. There is no dial you can turn to delivery value faster, software teams are not like cars, there's no acceleration paddle. Even if we try to speed up by adding more resources, in many cases the bottleneck will just become more apperent.
In our search for increased delivery of value, we go hunt for these bottlenecks. No two contexts are the same, and for this story we have a certain context in mind. However, symptoms in different organisations are often similar and our story might apply to your context if you recognise the problems we encountered.
## Symptoms
There might be numerous speed-related symptoms you observe in your organization, but today, for our story, we would like to bring your attention to the following three:
 1. Perception of slowness
 2. Lack of collaboration
 3. There is nothing to show during the sprint review
  
### Perception of slowness
Speed is a new currency. If you are fast, chances are you gonna be the first on a market with that new exciting feature. 
It is not anymore about being better, it is about being first. Everyone is interested in what’s new. Few people are interested in what’s better. Every business knows that to compete they have to be faster than their competition.

Therefore, lack of speed is noticed quite quikly: competitors deliver features that are still on your future roadmap; you struggle to answer what was built last quarter or even last year. 

### Lack of collaboration
Collaboration is the action of working with someone to produce something. It happens via an exchange of ideas that leads to creation of new and enhanced ideas and allows you to produce best designs and best software. Collaboration is a sourse of creativity and innovation, it promotes healthy employee relationships. It also creates faster feedback loop and allows issues to be found and resolved earlier in the process.

In the heart of collaboration is communication. So look at how people communicate: with each other, with you. Do they prefer face-to-face or email and slack are their goto options? Do you see people working behind one computer? On the sprint board you see that everything is in progrees, but only few items, if any, are done; teams(s) often fail making the sprint and spill it over to the next one.

There are many reasons why people don't collaborate: they don't see the benefits of it, they are afraid of being wrong and therefore vulnerable, they don't trust their teammates, they've tried before only to have their opinion ignored, and maybe - running ahead here - there is nothing to collaborate on.

### Team has nothing to show during the sprint review
Good place for forming an opinion about time to market is a sprint review meeting. During the sprint review, the scrum team and stakeholders collaborate about what was done in the sprint. 

Do the sprint review meetings happen regularly? 
Do the teams have something to review? 
Do you feel like progress is continuosly being made? 
Or maybe you catch yourself wondering what the teams have been doing the entire sprint as they have very little of nothing to review. 
  
## Value stream
One way to examine your development process is to [create a value stream map or VSM](https://xebia.com/blog/how-to-create-a-value-stream-map/). It is basically an inventory of all the activities that happen before a piece of software hits production. You also want to know how much time each of the activities take. Once you have that, you can put them in two buckets: value adding activities and non-value adding or waste. Give examples of activities of each category.
Of course you still don't know what items are valuable by themselves. For that you need another metric.
waste in the process
## Metrics
#### 1. Value adding vs non-value adding product backlog items (Epic stuff vs other stuff)
waste in the content
Add an image of epic vs other stuff.
Excersize similar to mapping the VSM could be performed against your backlog. You could put all the work into same two buckets value adding and non-value adding. Both are important, we need to add new value while maintaining the existing value of our products. Once you have a distribution of work, e.g. ratio between value adding and non-value adding items you can drill down on each of them and get more insights. Having a lot of non-value adding work might create a perception of slowness.
You can go further and drill down into what is on your non-value adding product backlog items and understand what is the underlying issue there, maybe you have a lot of bugs and there is a quality problem, or maybe it is a tech debt that's holding you back and doesn't allow to extend the product. 
Having this data, you can get an idea of your team speed if you devide amount of work done by number of days whithing which it was completed.
You can go further and measure the speed of individual features to see if you can support your perception of slowness with data.
#### 2. Speed of the feature(s) (items per day)
Make an assumption that epics are value adding
Image with the epic speed vs total speed.
How does it compare to the total speed? Is it even close? Or those two are far apart? If your answer to this question is yes, you might want to find out why this is the case. There's is a lot of different routes you can take from here, for example, you could start looking into the actual content of the slow features. In our context we opted for a different route.
Given the symptoms we discussed earlier, the perception of slowness, which is now backed by data, the lack of collaboration, and the unclear sprint goal, we decided to look into parrallel work. 

[//]: # (This comparison can either give you some answers or raise more questions.)
#### 3. Number of parallel value adding contexts
Image with the gantt chart and parallel features
By plotting the work on the different value adding contexts over time you can see where work on these different contexts overlap. Working on different contexts in the same timeframe suggests context switching. 
## Context switching
Most likely you already know that context switching is not your friend, but rather an enemy, that is stealing your time without you noticing it. Modern world is full of distractions: new email comes in, someone sends you a slack message, one of the numerous apps on your phone sends you a notification, social media constantly screaming for your attention. The world is designed to disctract you. It takes discipline and practice to restrain yourself from all these temptations, calling you every minute. But today we would like to leave daily distractions alone and focus on another level of context switching - project level. 

Many companies or individual product managers fail to properly prioritize and order their backlogs or have difficulties saying 'No' to their numerous stakeholders. As result of these failures, their team is tasked to work on everything at the same time. As time goes by, everything is started, little is finished. Half done isn't done at all. And the cost of such decisions is very high. Gerald Weinberg in his book Quality Software Management: Systems Thinking offers an illustration of the cost of context switching:

![Context Switching](images/context-switching.png?raw=true "Waste precentage from switching context")

Jeff Sutherland in his book Scrum: The Art of Doing Twice the Work in Half the Time speaks at leangth about costs of context switching. He calls waste a crime and encourages agile teams to do one thing at a time. 

To get from context switching to focus:

## Solutions
- Target and why it is bad
- Focus
- WIP limit
- Focus on right stuff
- Budget(%/%)

.. and thus by increasing focus, and reducting context switching, we can expect a boost in productivity.

## Dream of engagement
Our story is done. The symptomps we observed led us through different measurements to find a bottleneck which we can now solve. Our resources can be more productive. Numbers go up, stakeholders are happy.

But are we happy? The resources we're dealing with, they are human beings, even worse, they are knowledge workers. In general we can assume that having a variety of responsibilites or different contexts is a strong motivator. Focus might have an opposite effect.

When we're dealing with people, we dream of increasing engangement. People that are engaged in the work they are doing are more productive. This is shown time and again by periodic research done by [Gallup](https://news.gallup.com/reports/191489/q12-meta-analysis-report-2016.aspx). Not only does it have a positive effect on productivity, it also correlates for example with higher quality work.

We can influence engagement. There is a [strong correlation](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1096700.pdf) between engagement and intrinsic motivation, and improving intrinsic motivation is what we like to do! There are [many motivators](https://noop.nl/2013/02/champfrogs.html) that drive people intrinsicly. So how can focus be an influence here?

A lack of focus might cause a lack of a goal, a clear purpose. When we try to create more focus we should start with a clear and compelling goal and go from there. Focus can also possitively influence order, a more stable environment. Or it can increase relatedness from the required collaboration.

Focus not to increase productivity alone, but to increase engagement as well. Now we need to look for a fourth measure, to validate. The measure of engagement.
