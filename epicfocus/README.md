# How to assess your team focus / Focused team is a happy team / Driving engagement by creating focus
## Deliver value faster
There are a bunch of recurring wishes our clients bring to us, one of which is speed. There is no dial that you can turn to deliver value faster. Software teams are not like cars; there's no acceleration paddle. Even if we try to speed up by adding more resources, in many cases, the bottleneck will just become more apparent.
In our search for increased delivery of value, we hunt for these bottlenecks. No two contexts are the same, and for this story, we have a particular context in mind. However, symptoms in different organizations are often similar, and our story might apply to your setting if you recognize the problems we encountered.
## Symptoms
There might be numerous speed-related symptoms you observe in your organization, but today, for our story, we would like to bring your attention to the following three:
 1. Perception of slowness
 2. Lack of collaboration
 3. There is nothing to show during the sprint review
  
### Perception of slowness
Speed is a new currency. If you are fast, chances are you going to be the first on the market with that new exciting feature. 
It is not anymore about being better; it is about being first. Everyone is interested in what's new. Few people are interested in what's better. Every business knows that to compete, they have to be faster than their competition.

Therefore, lack of speed is noticed quite quickly: competitors deliver features that are still on your future roadmap; you struggle to answer what you built last quarter or even last year. 

### Lack of collaboration
Collaboration is the action of working with someone to produce something. It happens via an exchange of ideas that leads to the creation of new and enhanced ideas and allows you to deliver the best designs and best software. Collaboration is a source of creativity and innovation; it promotes healthy employee relationships. It also creates a faster feedback loop and allows issues to be found and resolved earlier in the process.

In the heart of collaboration is communication. So look at how people communicate: with each other, with you. Do they prefer face-to-face communication, or are email and slack their goto options? Do you see people working behind one computer? On the sprint board, you see that everything is in progress, but only a few items, if any, are done; teams(s) often fail to make the sprint and spill it over to the next one.

There are many reasons why people don't collaborate. They don't see the benefits of it, are afraid of being wrong and therefore vulnerable,  don't trust their teammates, or they've tried before only to have their opinion ignored. And maybe even - running ahead here - there is nothing on which to collaborate.

### Team has nothing to show during the sprint review
A good place for forming an opinion about time to market is a sprint review meeting. During the sprint review, the scrum team and stakeholders converse about the advance made in the sprint. 

Do the sprint review meetings happen regularly? 
Do the teams have something to review? 
Do you feel like there is continuous progress? 
Or maybe you catch yourself wondering what the teams have been doing the entire sprint as they have very little of nothing to review. 
  
## Value stream
One way to examine your development process is to [create a value stream map or VSM](https://xebia.com/blog/how-to-create-a-value-stream-map/). It is an inventory of all the activities that happen before a piece of software hits production. You also want to know how much time each of the actions takes. Once you have that, you can put them in two buckets: value-adding activities and non-value adding or waste. Give examples of activities in each category.
Of course, you still don't know what items are valuable by themselves. For that, you need another metric.
waste in the process
## Metrics
#### 1. Value-adding vs. non-value adding product backlog items (Epic stuff vs. other stuff)
waste in the content
Add an image of epic vs. other stuff.
Exercise similar to mapping the VSM could be performed against your backlog. You could put all the work into the same two buckets value-adding and non-value adding. Both are important; we need to add new value while maintaining the existing value of our products. Once you have a distribution of work, e.g., the ratio between value-adding and non-value adding items, you can drill down on each of them and get more insights. Having a lot of non-value adding work might create a perception of slowness.
You can go further and drill down into what is on your non-value adding product backlog items and understand what is the underlying issue there, maybe you have a lot of bugs, and there is a quality problem, or perhaps it is a tech debt that's holding you back and doesn't allow to extend the product. 
Having this data, you can get an idea of your team speed if you divide the amount of work done by the number of days within which it was completed.
You can go further and measure the speed of individual features to see if you can support your perception of slowness with data.
#### 2. Speed of the feature(s) (items per day)
Assume that epics are value-adding
Image with the epic speed vs. total speed.
How does it compare to the total speed? Is it even close? Or those two are far apart? If your answer to this question is yes, you might want to find out why this is the case. There's a lot of different routes you can take from here, for example, you could start looking into the actual content of the slow features. In our context, we opted for a different route.
Given the symptoms, we discussed earlier, the perception of slowness, which is now backed by data, the lack of collaboration, and the unclear sprint goal, we decided to look into parallel work. 

[//]: # (This comparison can either give you some answers or raise more questions.)
#### 3. Number of parallel value-adding contexts
Image with the Gantt chart and parallel features
By plotting the work on the different value-adding contexts over time, you can see where work on these different contexts overlaps. Working on different contexts in the same timeframe suggests context switching. 
## Context switching
Most likely, you already know that context switching is not your friend, but rather an enemy, that is stealing your time without you noticing it. The modern world is full of distractions: new email comes in, someone sends you a Slack message, one of the numerous apps on your phone sends you a notification, social media constantly screaming for your attention. The world is designed to distract you. It takes discipline and practice to restrain yourself from all these temptations, calling you every minute. But today we would like to leave daily distractions alone and focus on another level of context switching - project level. 

Many companies or individual product managers fail to prioritize properly and order their backlogs or have difficulties saying 'No' to their numerous stakeholders. As a result of these failures, their team is tasked to work on everything at the same time. As time goes by, everything is started, little is finished. Half done isn't done at all. And the cost of such decisions is very high. Gerald Weinberg, in his book Quality Software Management: Systems Thinking offers an illustration of the cost of context switching:

![Context Switching](images/context-switching.png?raw=true "Waste percentage from switching context")

Jeff Sutherland, in his book Scrum: The Art of Doing Twice the Work in Half the Time, speaks at length about costs of context switching. He calls waste crime and encourages agile teams to do one thing at a time.

## Solutions
  Acknowledgement of a problem is the first step towards its solution. There are number of things you could do next. And at first, we wanted to give you some tips. But those seemed obvious and tricky at the same time. We wanted to tell you to focus, focus on the right stuff, but often times it is easier said than done. We don't know your context and the reasons why this is happening in your organization. You might struggle to identify the right one from many or, perhaps, have difficulties explaining to your stakeholders why their project has to be put on hold.
So, instead of giving an advice, we would like to ask you what would you do? How would you tackle this dysfuction? Would you address it at all?

There is one more thing that we wanted to warn you about. Now, having the time to market calculated as a single number, it might be tempting to use it as a baseline and set a target to grow it, turn it into the new KPI. To be honest, that was my first instinct. After discussing it, we came into conclusion that it is not a good idea. The number can be easily gamed without giving you extra speed back. For example, by creating more of smaller size tickets the speed number will go up, but are you really going faster? We think it would benefit you to re-measure your focus and speed some time after you've implemented a change to see what is the effect of it. 

We strongly believe that by increasing focus and reducing context switching, you can expect a boost in productivity.

## Dream of engagement
Our story is done. The symptoms we observed led us through different measurements to find a bottleneck that we can now solve. Our resources can be more productive. Numbers go up, stakeholders are happy.

But are we happy? The resources we're dealing with they are human beings; even worse, they are knowledge workers. In general, we can assume that having a variety of responsibilities or different contexts is a strong motivator. Focus might have an opposite effect.

When we're dealing with people, we dream of increasing engagement. People that are engaged in the work they are doing are more productive. This is shown time and again by periodic research done by [Gallup](https://news.gallup.com/reports/191489/q12-meta-analysis-report-2016.aspx). Not only does it have a positive effect on productivity, but it also correlates, for example, with higher quality work.

We can influence engagement. There is a [strong correlation](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1096700.pdf) between engagement and intrinsic motivation, and improving intrinsic motivation is what we like to do! There are [many motivators](https://noop.nl/2013/02/champfrogs.html) that drive people intrinsically. So how can focus be an influence here?

A lack of focus might cause a lack of a goal, a clear purpose. When we try to create more focus, we should start with a clear and compelling goal and go from there. Focus can also positively influence order, a more stable environment. Or it can increase relatedness from the required collaboration.

Focus not to increase productivity alone, but to increase engagement as well. Now we need to look for a fourth measure; to validate — the measure of engagement.

### Acknowledgements
Neither the research nor this blog would see the world if it wasn't for Jochum Borger, my colleague and friend, who has supported me all this time by co-creating, giving continuous feedback, and actually writing it together with me. Thank you, your contribution is invaluable!
