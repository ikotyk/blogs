Message:
 - Test automators are siloed by definition
 - Harmfull:
   - Monopoly/responsibility on test automation
   - Bottleneck
   - Late feedback
   - Not testing
   - Don't add customer value
   - Prioritize implementation of checks over exploration
   - Mentality, resonsibility of writing tests, not validating the product
   - Often not real developers
   - Single point of failure
   - Mostly focus on e2e
 - Should be team responsibility
 - Should disappear
 - Shift left





Story:
- Bugs go to prod, should have been found
- Obvious solution: build more tests
-


- Problem --> Speed: manual regression testing takes a long time
- Solution: automated regression testing
- Problem --> Quality: test automator is harmful
- Solution: quality and automation as a team responsibility, people exploring the product
